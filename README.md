# Project Management Dashboard

A React-based dashboard for managing support and maintenance clients. Client data is persisted in a JSON file via a Node.js/Express backend server.

## Features

- Add, edit, and archive clients
- Persistent data storage in JSON file (`data/clients.json`)
- Modern, responsive UI
- Separate views for active and archived clients

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the backend server (in one terminal):
```bash
npm run server
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

3. Start the React app (in another terminal):
```bash
npm start
```
The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run server`

Starts the Express backend server on port 3001.\
The server handles API requests and manages the `data/clients.json` file.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
